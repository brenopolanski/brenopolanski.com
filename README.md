This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Code Quality Tools

This project uses several tools to ensure code quality:

### Husky and lint-staged

[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) is used to enforce code quality checks before commits. [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged) runs linters on staged files to catch issues before they're committed.

- **pre-commit hook**: Runs ESLint and Prettier on staged files
